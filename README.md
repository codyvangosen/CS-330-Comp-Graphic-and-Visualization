Project Reflection
How do I approach designing software?
Designing software requires a structured and iterative approach, focusing on both usability and performance. I begin with defining requirements and outlining system components. I followed the software development life cycle (SDLC) for this project, emphasizing modularity and reusability to make enhancements easier.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project strengthened my spatial reasoning and 3D modeling skills, particularly in:

Understanding how lighting and shading models impact object visibility.
Using transformation matrices to manipulate objects in a 3D space.
Managing camera movement and perspective for a more immersive scene.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a top-down design approach, breaking the scene into smaller components:

Concept Planning – Sketching out the environment and defining key objects.
Modeling – Using OpenGL to build 3D objects with proper vertex attributes.
Texturing & Lighting – Implementing Phong shading and texture mapping.
Testing & Iteration – Adjusting camera angles, lighting, and transformations.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The modular approach I used here applies to future projects, especially in game development, augmented reality (AR), or computer simulations. I can ensure efficiency and scalability by breaking down projects into components and refining them iteratively.

How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs requires a problem-solving mindset. I focus on writing clear, maintainable, and optimized code. For this project, I followed:

Incremental development, testing components separately.
Debugging with visual feedback, ensuring transformations behaved as expected.
Performance optimization, reducing unnecessary rendering calculations.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Scene Graph Hierarchy: Organizing objects in a tree structure for transformations.
Shader Programming: Writing custom GLSL shaders to improve realism.
Frame Rate Optimization: Managing polygon count to balance performance and visual fidelity.
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was critical in refining the:

Lighting Model – Adjusting ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting effects.
Camera Controls – Fine-tuning movement and perspective settings.
Object Placement – Ensuring a natural and visually appealing layout.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
Initially, I focused on basic object rendering, but over time, I incorporated:

Advanced texture mapping for realism.
Complex animations to enhance interactivity.
User input handling for dynamic scene adjustments.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science empowers me to solve real-world problems through technology. My focus is on software development and data analytics, and computational graphics has given me skills that can be applied to game development, simulation modeling, and interactive applications.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This course has improved my understanding of:

Linear algebra and matrix transformations in 3D graphics.
Efficient rendering techniques to manage system performance.
Visualization principles that apply to scientific and business applications.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In software engineering, these skills are valuable for UI/UX design, 3D application development, and simulations.
In data analytics, visualization techniques can be used to present insights through interactive dashboards.
In automation and simulation fields, 3D modeling and OpenGL concepts can be applied to robotics, medical imaging, and AR/VR applications.

Conclusion
This project has been an invaluable experience in 3D graphics programming, design thinking, and iterative development. The concepts learned here will serve as a foundation for future work in software development, data visualization, and interactive applications.
